## About The Project

<p>If you're new to HTML and CSS, this is a great first challenge. Because the card layout does not change, it is ideal if you have not yet learned how to create responsive layouts.
The main challenge is to build out this QR code component and make it look as close to the design as possible.
You can use whatever tools you want to help you complete the challenge. So, if you want to practise something, go ahead.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Taildwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned
Quite simple project for someone new to development! The only issue I had was with the height of the flex container, which appeared different in Safari. So I changed my approach slightly, which is why I had so many changes in this simple project.
## Useful resources

1. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - Paste your design image to check the size of containers, width, etc.
2. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi">Perfect Pixel</a> - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
